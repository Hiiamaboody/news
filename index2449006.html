    <font size="4"><h1>Israeli War Crime</h1>
	<font size="5"><p>Israeli Defense Uses illegal Missiles That Contain White Phosphorus that Burns In The Air which causes fires and severe injuries.Israel wont fix anything they made which caused gaza mass destruction. Camps for Palestinian people had taken a huge place in helping these people which people wont forget for there entire life.As a Result some kids and Adults are not living on the streets with no food or a roof on top of their head and some water.On the other hand the president of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas is not trying to stand up for his country.which is giving palestinian people no hope in their goverment the only hope for them is Hamas and Hezb Allah which has a huge impact on this war for protecting the palestinian citizens from these greedy pigs.</p>

	<font size="4"><h2>Missiles</h2>
	<font size="5"><p>Israel uses the AIM-7 Sparrows it comes from the USA and has a medium range and others like the AIM-9 sidewider and the AIM-120 AMRAAM.On the other hand,Hamas acquires its weapons through smuggling or local construction and receives some military support from Iran.Hezbollah Uses Burkan missiles which can cause huge destruction and BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Urgan, Fajr-3 with the most range that could go 43Km.</p>
	<font size="5"><h3>Soldiers</h3>
	<font size="5"><p>While israel has 634,500 soldiers in total with 169,500 active and 465,000 Reserved personnel. while hamas has 20,000-25,000 soldiers with hezbollah having 100,000 soldiers.</p>
	<font size="5"><h4>Deaths</h4>
	<font size="5"><p>The deaths of the Palestinian side is 30,000 7,000 from them are unknown/lost and 1,400 are kids.On the other side israeli deaths are 1400 with 793 soldiers and the rest are citizens</p>
	
	<font size="6"><h5>Economy</h5>
	<font size="5"><p>In israel the economy impact was huge and since the war started with hamas/Palestine it costed them $260 Million per day.On the other hand,palestine got a lower GDP drop losing $1.7 Billion. If we Multiply $216 Million by 83 it means that israel has lost $17.98 Billion or even 50-60 billion which will affect them so much in the next few years and will affect the egyptian GDP also because of the houth targeting the red sea ships.</p>
